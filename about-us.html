Benada Workshop is owned by two brothers, who enjoy working with wood to create products that are functional and beautiful. Their workshop is located in the garage of their family home. Weekends and after school hours are dedicated to working to bring you pieces hand crafted with care. The Benada family uses essential oils on a daily basis and recognizes the importance of having oils stored in a convenient manner. With Benada holders, essential oils will not only be organized, but they look decorative as well.
